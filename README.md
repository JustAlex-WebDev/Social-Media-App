# WONDER

## About
WONDER is a start-up social media app designed for all ages. My objective is to provide an inspirational focused social media experience which expands one's circle of interests. I designed and developed this product from beginning to end following a human-centered design philosophy over the steps of my design and development process. Consequently, the app is not only easy to navigate around, but beatifull to look at too! 

## Development 
Some of the technologies used throughout the development of this application are React, Firebase and Tailwind. There are custom hooks, dynamic and protected routes (React-Router-Dom) and integrated authentication (Firebase). Futhermore, there is a thechnology used for the transition betweeen the pages (Framer Motion) and a close to perfect state management (useContext).
